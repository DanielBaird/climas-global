<h2>About this tool</h2>
<p>
CliMAS Reports provides a regional report on change in temperature, rainfall, and species composition for a selected region and year.
</p><p>
It summarises mapped biodiversity of all birds, reptiles, frogs and mammals within suitable climate space projected by 18 different Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 2 potential emissions scenarios (RCPs) from 2015 to 2085.  Detailed lists of climate space losses and gains for each species are given.
</p><p>
This enables visitors to visualise climate change in their region and to determine priority species.
</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
Currently there is a general lack of engagement and knowledge transfer between professional researchers and end-users of research (general public, conservation managers, decision-makers, etc.). This is reflected in a general lack of acceptance and acknowledgement by the public and stakeholders of the potential impacts of climate change, particularly on biodiversity.
</p><p>
Recently, researchers have begun to endeavour to make the results of their research public, however there is a scarcity online tools that display species distribution data.  CliMAS Reports site provides a tool that reuses data available with Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Tropical Data Hub to allow a broad range of end-users to explore the potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial vertebrate species in their region.
