## Introduction

Patterns of biodiversity are already shifting as a result of the changing climate.  However, there is little information available regarding how climate might change at a regional level, and how this change might impact regional species distributions in the future.  This lack of relevant regional infomation makes the task of future planning extremely difficult for regional biodiversity managers.

### Regional Future Climate[[section_biodiversity > 0]] and Species Distribution[[always]]

This report uses future Global Circulation Models (GCMs) to project the impact of both low and high emissions scenarios on climate[[section_biodiversity > 0]] and biodiversity[[always]] in the future.  It shows how annual mean temperature and rainfall change decadally to 2085, and the resulting regional spatial pattern of change[[year == 2085 AND section_biodiversity > 0]] and biodiversity implications [[always]] in 2085[[year == 2085]].[[year < 2085]], but discussion focuses on the projected climate[[year < 2085 AND section_biodiversity > 0]] and biodiversity implications[[year < 2085]] in {{year}}.

Biodiversity changes, including climate space losses and gains, is also summarised[[section_appendices > 0]], and detailed lists of all species gained, lost, or retained are reported[[section_biodiversity > 0]].[[always]]
