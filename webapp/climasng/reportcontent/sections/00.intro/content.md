# Introduction

Patterns of biodiversity are already shifting as a result of the changing climate.  However, there is very little information available regarding how climate might change at a regional level, let alone how this change might impact regional species distributions in the future.  This lack of relevant regional infomation makes the task of future planning extremely difficult for regional biodiversity managers.

## Regional Future Climate and Species Distribution

** adapt to comment on included sections only

This report uses future Global Circulation Models (GCMs) to project the impact of both low and high emissions scenarios on biodiversity in the future.  It shows how annual mean temperature and rainfall change decadally to 2085 and the resulting regional spatial pattern of change in 2085[[rpt_year == 2085]].[[rpt_year < 2085]], but focuses on the projected climate and biodiversity situation in {{rpt_year}}.

Biodiversity changes, including climate space losses and gains, is summarised, and detailed lists of all species lost, gained, or kept are reported.
