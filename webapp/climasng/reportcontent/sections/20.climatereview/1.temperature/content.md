### Temperature

All of Australia is projected to experience warming in the future.  Mean average temperature across {{rg_name}} ranges from {{baseline_t_min, round 0.1}} to {{baseline_t_max, round 0.1}}&deg;C, averaging {{baseline_t_mean, round 0.1}}&deg;C across the region.

[[ hi_{{year}}_t_mean_50th >0.1> baseline_t_mean ]]
By {{year}}, the mean temperature across the region for the high emission scenario is projected to be in the range {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_10th, round 0.1}} to {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_90th, round 0.1}}&deg;C, an average {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, change}} of {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1, absolute}}&deg;C.
[[ year != 2085 ]]By 2085, most GCMs project that annual mean temperature across the region will fall in the range {{hi_2085_t_mean_10th, round 0.1}} &ndash; {{hi_2085_t_mean_90th, round 0.1}}&deg;C in the high emission scenario, with the best estimate being {{hi_2085_t_mean_50th, round 0.1}}&deg;C.

Figure 1 tracks mean annual temperature projections in {{rg_name}} between 2015 and 2085.

Figure 2 shows the projected {{lo_{{year}}_t_mean_10th - baseline_t_mean, change increase change}} in annual average temperature across {{rg_name}}, in low and high emission scenarios.  The images of the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles visualise the variation between the 18 different GCMs.  The 10th percentile value {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_10th, round 0.1}}&deg;C depicts the lower end of projected change, a variation of {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1}}&deg;C, and the 90th percentile represents the high end of temperature change, projected to be {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_90th, round 0.1}}&deg;C ({{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_90th - baseline_t_mean, change 'an increase' 'a decrease' 'a change'}} of {{hi_{{year}}_t_mean_90th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1}}&deg;C), both for the high scenario.
