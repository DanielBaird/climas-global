### Temperature

All of Australia is projected to experience warming in the future.  The mean annual temperature for {{ rg_name }} is {{ baseline_t_mean, round 0.1 }}&deg;C.

[[ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_50th > baseline_t_mean ]]
By {{rpt_year}}, mean regional temperature is projected to be in the range {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_10th, round 0.1 }} &ndash; {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_90th, round 0.1 }}&deg;C, a mean {{hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, change}} of {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1, absolute }}&deg;C.
[[ rpt_year != 2085 ]]
By 2085 mean temperatures in the region are likely to be in the range {{ hi_2085_t_mean_10th, round 0.1 }} &ndash; {{ hi_2085_t_mean_90th, round 0.1 }}&deg;C.

Figure 1 tracks increase of mean annual temperature in {{ rg_name }} between 2015 and 2085.

Figure 2 shows the projected {{ lo_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_10th - baseline_t_mean, change increase change }} in annual average temperature across {{ rg_name }}, in low and high emission scenarios.  The images of the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles visualise the variation between the 18 different GCMs.  The 10th percentile value {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_10th, round 0.1 }}&deg;C depicts the lower end of projected change, a variation of {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_50th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1 }}&deg;C, and the 90th percentile represents the high end of temperature change, projected to be {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_90th, round 0.1 }}&deg;C ({{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_90th - baseline_t_mean, change 'an increase' 'a decrease' 'a change' }} of {{ hi_{{rpt_year}}_t_mean_90th - baseline_t_mean, round 0.1 }}&deg;C), both for the high scenario.
