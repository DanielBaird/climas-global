## Future Climate

Climate data was sourced from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) to calculate important climate variables such as current annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and annual precipitation.  We calculated likely future values for each climate variable considered important to vertebrate distributions using 18 global climate models (GCMs) for representative concentration pathways (RCPs) representing high and low emission scenarios at 8 time steps between 2015 and 2085.

In this report, we consider RCP8.5 to represent 'business as usual' and refer to this emission scenario as "high".  We consider RCP4.5 to represent a low, potentially achievable emissions target and refer to this scenario as "low".  Explanations focus on the high scenario.
