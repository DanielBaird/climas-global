## Projection of Future Climate

Climate data was sourced from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) to calculate important climate variables such as current annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, and annual precipitation. We calculated likely future climate for each climate variable considered important to vertebrate distributions using all 18 global climate models (GCMs) for a high and low RCP scenario (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) at 8 time steps between 2015 and 2085.

In this report, we consider RCP8.5 to represent 'business as usual', and RCP4.5 to represent a low, potentially achievable emissions target.  All explanations focus on the high scenario as it represents the best projection of our current trajectory.
