### Regional Biodiversity Implications for Crayfish

{{rg_name}} currently hosts {{baseline_b_crayfish_count}} crayfish species that were modelled.  [[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_50th > baseline_b_crayfish_count / 5 OR hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_50th > baseline_b_crayfish_count / 5]]By {{year}} crayfish biodiversity in this region is projected to undergo significant change. [[never]]

[[  hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_90th > baseline_b_crayfish_count

]]There is little agreement between models on whether this species count will increase or decrease. Projections range from a decrease of as many as {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_10th - baseline_b_crayfish_count, absolute}} species to an increase of up to {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_90th - baseline_b_crayfish_count, absolute}} species.

[[  hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_90th <= baseline_b_crayfish_count

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_50th =5%= baseline_b_crayfish_count ]]
Even a relatively stable species count may be the result of gains offset by losses.[[never]]

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_count_50th >5%< baseline_b_crayfish_count]]
Changes to the region's species count may not be the full story, as gains and losses offset each other.[[never]]

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_90th > 0 ]]
Models agree that by {{year}}, between {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_90th}} and {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_10th}} of current crayfish species will be lost to the region, with a median expected loss of {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_50th}} species.

[[  hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_90th == 0
and hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_50th > 0 ]]
Most models project a loss of some species by {{year}}, with a median of {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_50th}} lost species and some models predicting losses of up to {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_10th}} species.

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_50th == 0 and hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_10th < 0 ]]
Some models project losses of up to {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_10th}} species, however most models agree that by {{year}} no species will be lost.

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_loss_10th == 0 ]]
Models agree however that by {{year}}, none of the modelled crayfish species currently in {{rg_name}} will be lost to the region.

Climate variation in {{rg_name}} may also result in the arrival of crayfish species previously not found in the region.[[never]]

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_10th > 0 ]]
Models agree that by {{year}}, between {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_10th}} and {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th}} additional crayfish species will live in the region, with a median expected gain of {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_50th}} species.

[[  hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_10th == 0
and hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_50th > 0 ]]
Most models project some crayfish species arriving by {{year}}, with a median of {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_50th}} new species and some models predicting up to {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th}} new species.

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_50th == 0 and hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th < 0 ]]
Some models project gains of up to {{hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th}} species, however most models agree that by {{year}} no new crayfish species will arrive.

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th == 0 ]]
However, models agree that by {{year}} no new crayfish species will enter the region.

[[ hi_{{year}}_b_crayfish_gain_90th > 0 ]]

In light of possible species gains, it is important to consider that even Australian natives may behave like invasive pests when entering new space.  Interaction with other species has not been modelled.
