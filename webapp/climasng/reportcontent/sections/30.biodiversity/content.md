## Projection of Future Species Distribution

Species distribution models were generated using climate data and species observation records.

Records for birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles were retrieved from the Atlas of Living Australia database, with additional records from source A for freshwater fish, source B for stream frogs, source C for turtles, and source D for selected weeds.  These occurrence records were filtered to exclude records with obvious issues.  BirdLife Australia provided detailed species range information that allowed us to model only bird observation records that fall within core habitat.  Expert researchers from James Cook University vetted the data for mammals, amphibians and reptiles.  *** add vetting comments for extra species groups.

These distribution models are built for two of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, analogous to greenhouse gas emission scenarios) using the mid-point of 18 global climate models (GCMs) at decadal time steps between 2015 and 2085.

Only species with >10 unique location records are modeled.

Climate suitability maps for a species represent what scientists call a Species Distribution Model. These models shows the relationship between where species have currently been observed and the climate at that location. Once the relationship between climate and observations is known, it can be projected into the future using GCMs.

All climate suitability maps for a chosen taxon are converted to binary (sutable/unsuitable) and summed to create species richness maps.

** adapt to discuss actual presence and dispersal

Importantly, all potentially suitable climate space is shown, even if the species has not been observed there, or could not realistically move there in the future.  We show this because species can be relocated, intentionally (ie. for their preservation) or unintentionally (where they may become pests).
