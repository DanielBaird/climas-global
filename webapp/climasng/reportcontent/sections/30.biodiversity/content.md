## Projection of Future Species Distribution

Species distribution models were generated using climate data and species observation records.

TODO: confirm if freshwater fish, freshwater crayfish, weeds used ALA data

Species records were retrieved from the Atlas of Living Australia database, with additional records from source A for freshwater fish, source B for stream frogs, source C for turtles, and source D for selected weeds.  These occurrence records were filtered to exclude records with obvious issues.  BirdLife Australia provided detailed species range information that allowed us to model only bird observation records that fall within core habitat.  Expert researchers from James Cook University vetted the data for mammals, amphibians and reptiles.  TODO: add vetting comments for extra species groups.

These distribution models are built for two of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, analogous to greenhouse gas emission scenarios) using the median of 18 global climate models (GCMs) at decadal time steps between 2015 and 2085.

Only species with valid observations in more than ten unique locations are modeled.

Climate suitability maps for a species represent what scientists call a Species Distribution Model. These models shows the relationship between where species have currently been observed and the climate at that location. Once the relationship between climate and observations is known, it can be projected into the future using GCMs.

Estimates on each species' ability to disperse from known populated areas are used to clip areas of suitable climate, creating projected distribution ranges.Water flow data are used to project dispersal of fish, crayfish, turtles and some species of frog.

Projected distribution maps for each taxon are converted to binary (present/not present), and species richness maps generated by counting the number of species projected to be present at each mapped point.
