/* SITE */
Server side: Python/Pyramid app, wasn't much fun to write
Client side: Hand-rolled javascript hooked onto a Backbone frame that Daniel is embarassed by.  Leaflet for map display.

/* TOOLS */
Daniel used Sublime Text 2 on OSX Mavericks for editing, and Vagrant for running Linux testing VMs.

Erin used R (and James Cook Uni's HPC) via a Windows machine for grinding the data.
